With regard to any file or content you upload to the public portions of our site, you grant ImagePXL a non-exclusive, royalty- free, perpetual, irrevocable worldwide license (with sublicense and assignment rights) to use, to display online and in any present or future media, to create derivative works of, to allow downloads of, and/or distribute any such file or content.

                <li>Identification of the material on our servers that is claimed to be infringing and that is to be
                removed, including the URL or other information to enable us to locate the material;</li>
                <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner
                complained of is not authorized by you as copyright owner, or by your agent, or by law;</li>

                you are the owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the exclusive copyright
                right that is allegedly being infringed.</li>
                <li>Your physical or electronic signature, or of someone authorized to act on your behalf;</li>
                <li>Instructions on how we may contact you: preferably email, but also address and phone</li>

If we receive a DMCA notice and remove something you posted anonymously, we will have no way of notifying you, so you will have to contact us if you think that may have happened. Keep in mind that we reserve the right to remove any content at any time whether or not it infringes or violates any of our policies.</p>
